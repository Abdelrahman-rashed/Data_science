# ("Ford GoBike" Data-set Exploration and Data visualization)
## by Abdelrahman Rashed


## Dataset

Bay Wheels is a regional public bicycle sharing system in California's San Francisco Bay Area. It is operated by Motivate in a partnership with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and the Bay Area Air Quality Management District.Bay Wheels is the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. It was established as Bay Area Bike Share in August 2013. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose.

In June 2017 the system was officially re-launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company. After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019. The system is expected to expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose.

Here I have investigated the data in (2018) between January till September.

## Summary of Findings

> Summarize all of your findings from your exploration here, whether you plan on bringing them into your explanatory presentation or not.

1. Univariate findings:
	1. Regarding distribution of the trips in the day, It is found that most of the rents take place between 8 am and 9 am in the morning and 5 pm and 6 pm in the evening.
	2. Refarding distribution of the trips in the year, It is found that trips in the summer is lareger in number than the trips in winter.
	3. Refarding distribution of the trips in the week, It is founf that the weekdays witness more number of trips than the weekends. 
	4. It is found that average age of the user is around [20-40].

2. Bivariate findings:
	1. Age of the user that use the system in the weekdays are larger than those who use it in the weekends.
	2. The customer users use the system in the weekend more oftern than the subscriber users.
	3. The subscriber users use the system in the weekdays more oftern than the customer users.
	4. The average age of the subscriber users s larger than the ones of the other category.
	5. Customer single trip duration is lareger than the subcriber users.
	
3. Multivariate findings:
	1. Starting from 'May' the number of users start to increase for the both groups. [summer months]
	2. Female users tend to have long trip duration more than the male users for the both gropus "Customer and Subscriber".


## Key Insights for Presentation 

>First insight:

> It is shown from investigating both [weekday vs user type] that the drop down in the count of trip during the weekend. This means that the people use the bikes in daily basis.
And this also indicate that the users the bike in their normal daily routine.This also can show and expresss the robustness and sucess of the system of 
'Ford GoBike' that it is able to be reliable and dependable.
This point can also be solidated by that fact that the number of subscribers is larger than the number of the customer users.
Another side point that show the sucess of the system is the average age of the users. The average age is around (20-40) which are the group of people that can use public transporation easily but they have choosed the system.

>Second insight:

From comparing the results of the three variables [Month vs user type vs member gender]. We can see that starting from 'May' the number of trips for both groups starts to increase. This is normal related to the customer users as I have insight from the previous sections that the customer users are students and they will use the system in the summer months.
In the other hand of the "subscriber" users, starting from 'May' the number of trips starts to increase. And this is not what I was expecting as I have the opposite insight that they are workers and tight to a daily routine all over the year.
I can deduce or relate this finding to the 'Weather' which is a common conditon for both groups. In winter the temperature is lower than in the summer as well as the possibility of rainy and snowy days is bigger.This could be the reason of why the number of trips is going down in the winter months.
